    <h2> We are extremely early in the universe </h2>

    <p> 
    Earth has existed for about 1/3rd of the time that the universe has.<br>
    Some stars smaller than ours are expected to fuse hydrogen for ten <br>
    trillion years, about 700x the current age of the universe. That puts us<br>
    in the top ~tenth of the top 'one percent' in terms of earliness,<br>
    assuming that energy must be taken from a star (as it always has been).
    <br>

       >But you don't need stars.</a><br>


   it's possible, in idea, to get energy from a black hole's gravity.<br>
   The biggest black holes are expected to be around for the next <br>
   <strong>GOOGOL</strong> years. Some form of life may be able to
   sustain<br>
   itself this way.<br><br>

   Something small and insignificant in the beginning, like an atom, <br>
   with its random movement and gravity, had a huge effect on <br>
   today's universe. <br>
   <br>
   In the same way, you matter perhaps more than you give yourself <br>
   credit for.<br>
