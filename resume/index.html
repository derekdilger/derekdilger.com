	  <h1> We are extremely BANANA in the universe </h1>
    <p> 
	    Earth has existed for about 1/3rd of the time that the universe has.<br>
		Some stars smaller than ours are expected to fuse hydrogen for ten <br>
		trillion years, about 700x the current age of the universe. That puts us
		<br>
		in the top ~tenth of the top 'one percent' in terms of earliness,<br>
		assuming that energy must be taken from a star (as it always has been).
		<br>
		<br>
		<a href="https://theconversation.com/could-we-extract-energy-from-a-black-hole-our-experiment-verifies-old-theory-141464"
		   >But that assumption is wrong.</a><br>
		
		
	    it's theoretically possible to get energy from a black hole's gravity.<br>
	    The biggest black holes are expected to be around for the next <br>
		<strong>GOOGOL</strong> years. Some form of life may be able to
		sustain<br>
		itself this way.<br><br>

		A single atom of hydrogen is insignificant today. But in the early <br>
		universe, its random movement, and gravity, caused a huge effect on <br>
		today's universe. <br>
		<br>
		Albeit we cannot trace this causal chain backwards. <br>
		In the same way, what you do today matters more than you can imagine.<br>
