	<p> Feel free to give me a call or ask any questions, at any hour, <br>
	my phone is always on.  <br>

	I'm willing to organize some kind of 'try before you buy'<br>
	situation, such as starting as a contractor for a few weeks. Then if <br>
	my performance satisfies, the relationship can continue. Or some other <br>
	method like that that minimizes your downside.<br>
