	    it's theoretically possible to get energy from a black hole's gravity.<br>
	    The biggest black holes are expected to be around for the next <br>
		<strong>GOOGOL</strong> years. Some form of life may be able to
		sustain<br>
		itself this way.<br><br>

		A single atom of hydrogen is insignificant today. But in the early <br>
		universe, its random movement, and gravity, caused a huge effect on <br>
		today's universe. <br>
		<br>
		Albeit we cannot trace this causal chain backwards. <br>
		In the same way, what you do today matters more than you can imagine.<br>
