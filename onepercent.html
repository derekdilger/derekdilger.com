      1.01 ^ 365 â‰ˆ 37 <br>
      If you ran just 1% faster each day for a year, you could run 37 times faster. (100 mph!!!) <br>
      If you typed just 1% faster each day for a year, could type 37 times faster. (1500 wpm!!!) <br>
      Obviously this can't be done.<br>
      As a rule, things inside yourself cannot be altered exponentially.<br>
      A better model for internal change is the logistic curve. <br>

      But external things can, like money, or followers, or . <br>
