        <h2> Changing ourselves </h2>
        <p>
        1.01 ^ 365 â‰ˆ 37 <br>
        <br>
        If you ran just 1% faster each day for a year, you could run 37 times<br>
        faster. (100 mph!!!) <br>
        <br>
        If you typed just 1% faster each day for a year, could type 37 times<br>
        faster. (1500 wpm!!!) <br>
        <br>
        Of course this can't be done.<br>
        As a rule things inside yourself cannot be changed exponentially<br>
        without diminishing returns. That implies unlimited growth or decay.<br>
        <br>
        A better model for internal change is: <br>
        <img src="expVsLogistic.jpg" 
             alt="exponential vs logistic growth"

        <br>
        <br>
        External things can, like money or followers. They have ceilings<br>
        too, just very high ones.<br>
        <br>
        This is probably one reason income inequality can be drastic.<br>
        There is a lot of matter internal (and external) to the system<br>
        that it wants to control. Once a good 'manager' of the stuff has<br>
        been found, the system keeps giving more to the manager.<br>
